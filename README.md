# CinemaTicketSystem


This project will improve the functionality of a cinema. The staff members will have two options prompted to them when they run the program, 
one is to update the data about the movies, dates, times and price, and the other is to make reservations for guests, 
which will include things like what day they want to reserve the seats for, which movie, at what venue. 
Each day of the week is going to have options for different movies at different times, 
at different venues (if the cinema has more than one).

This will get rid of the problem with people sitting in seats that weren’t reserved by them. 
It will improve the speed and quality of the service the cinema would offer without it, 
such as removing unnecessary waiting in lines, providing the ability to reserve seats online or over the phone, 
everything can get recorded easily and monitored with the program. 
The program will also provide a wide variety of options for snacks and/or drinks that will be billed to the 
same receipt as the movie ticket. 

We plan on making the whole menu system with a combination of if-else and switch statements, 
we also plan on using 2D arrays (matrixes) for the seat reservations and using: for, 
while and do while loops to check on the availability of free seats, 
we’re also going to use the GUI option (using the ‘import javax.swing.JOptionPane’ library) instead of the console approach. 

The if-else and switch statements are self-explanatory, we will use them to make all the menu options, 
we will use 2D arrays to store the information about the availability of the seats, 
and we will use for and/or while loops to go through the arrays and check for availability. 

The project is designed with the goal to make everyone’s life easier, the staff members as well as the customers.
